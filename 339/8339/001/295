<p class="hamesh">Most of Pfander's energy was devoted to language and translation work and to developing his refutation of Islam. Bishop Stephen Neill has described the Mizan as "one of the earliest works of Christian learning in the field" of Islamic scholarship,]١١[while the Basel Mission historian P. Eppler refers to Pfander's "extensive and penetrating knowledge of Islam."]١٢[One of his most enthusiastic admirers, Sir William Muir (١٨١٩١٩٠٥), however, thought that he made too little use of "the historical deductions of modern research."]١٣[Pfander does not qualify as a full-blown scholar of Islam, although he was willing to allow observation to modify his views and, in later editions of the Mizan, included references to the pioneering work of Gustav Weil (١٨٠٨ - ٨٩), one of the first European scholars to apply the historical-critical method to Muhammad's life.

He also shared the suspicion of most orientalist scholars of the Hadith (Traditions) as largely fictitious and historically unreliable.]١٦[<br><br>We can best gain an understanding of the flavor of Pfander's writing by summarizing the Mizan's argument. The introduction establishes the ground rules for the following three sections. First, Pfander proposes that,</p> </div>
