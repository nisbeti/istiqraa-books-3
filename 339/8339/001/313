<p class="hamesh">upright man forsake Islam. Why had he become so foolish to leave his religion? I resolved to debate the matter with him through correspondence, but to do it in a fair and unprejudiced manner. With this as my purpose I acquired copies of theTawrat and Injil. I collected cIjaz-i cIsawi, Istifsar, Izalat ul-Awham and other such works used in controversy. I requested Mr. Mackintosh kindly to teach me theInjil and said I would carefully study it. He gladly began to instruct me.<br>After reading seven chapters of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, doubts about Islam began to assail me. Once more I became so agitated that for days on end I studied books the whole of the day and often throughout the night. I discussed matters with padres and with Muslims. Within a year my study, to which I applied myself day and night, led me to understand that the religion of Islam is not from God, that Muslims are in error and that only Christianity offers salvation.<br>I explained my conclusion to Muslim scholars who were my friends and followers. Some were angry. Some met me in privacy, listening to all arguments. I asked them either to present better arguments or to accept Christianity with me. They plainly replied: "We know that the religion of Islam is not true. But what are we to do? We fear the abuse of the ignorant. In our hearts we really know that the Messiah is the true One and that Muhammad cannot be the intercessor for sinners. Still, we do not want to lose the respect and honour of men. Like us, do not reveal your faith. Call yourself a Muslim in public and in your heart believe in the Messiah." Others said: "The religion of Christ is correct and in accord with reason, but the doctrines of the Trinity and the Son of God make no sense to us and therefore we cannot accept it." Still others said: "We have not become Christians because we do not like some of the external practices of the Christians."<br>Thus their words revealed to me the nature of their integrity also! I committed them all into the hands of God, realising there was no way to help them other than by prayer. I went to Amritsar and received baptism from the hand of the Rev. Robert Clark of the CMS. I decided it right to take baptism from him primarily because he was the first of all the padres to write me, when I was in Lahore, telling me the Lord's message. His devotion and diligence also pleased me greatly. Later I wrote a book entitled Tahqiq ul-Iman for those Mawlawis who sit contentedly, trusting in Islam. At present I am preparing another book for which there is a great need, beseeching God to help me. If, as I pray, God helps me in its preparation, I am hopeful that it will be a very useful work to His glory. Currently I am residing in Lahore.<br>Padre Forman and Padre Guru Das have helped me greatly in my understanding of religion. I am benefited by their fellowship while attending their worship services. Padre Newton also has been a great blessing to me. He has helped me to find solutions to many religious problems.<br>Ever since I have entered into the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, I have had much spiritual satisfaction. The former agitation and restlessness have completely gone. My face is no longer so pallid. No longer do I experience great anxiety of heart. Through the reading of God's Word I have found great pleasure in life. Little remains of that sickness of fear for death and the grave, and I am wonderfully happy</p> </div>
