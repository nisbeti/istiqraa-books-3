<div class="nass margin-top-10"> <p><span id="p1" class="anchor"></span>The controversy has been recorded by the Indian Abdullah who was the second translator in Government House of Great Britainin Akbar Abad. The controversy took place between the Indian Rehmat Allahi, verse pastor Phandar, about twisted and the real knowledge and evidence of copying in the Christians. He has differentiated between copying the news and copying in the provisions and beliefs matters.<a href="#p1" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p2"></span>Phandar admitted twistedof the Book in seven or eight original positions and the presence of forty different twisted. He pretend that the twistedis a forgetfulness from the author and didn't cause any harm.<a href="#p2" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p3"></span>Dr.mlkkawi said that Sheikh Rahmatullah clarified that Phandar in his book "The balance of right" has used Muslims scientists words, increased, deleted them or changed them according to his benefits. Sometimes he inverted the words and answered them. Sheikh Rahmatullah clarified that he studied the Muslims scientist replies, took the scientists objections, then he added these objections as their main opinion to support his argument. Even if Phandar found more than one opinion in one subject, he took the weakest one, strength it, and reported that he hasn't found except this one. And so there will be no exaggeration to say that the book named "Show the right" is correction of the book name "The balance of right".<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
