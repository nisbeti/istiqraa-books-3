Pfander thought he was on familiar ground, since these were the subjects addressed in his apologetics. What he was not prepared for, though perhaps he should have been from the contents of Kitab-i-istifsar, one of the more scholarly replies to his writing, was his opponents' use of European biblical critics to impugn the integrity and historicity of Christian Scripture.
