<p><span class="anchor" id="p2"></span>- The title of the second chapter's research is "A methodical and procedural steps befor laying dwon the syntactical rules , and the declensional guiding . In this research , I made mention of the systematic steps of Sibawayh which he followed . It is summarized in four elements:<a href="#p2" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>

<p><span class="anchor" id="p7"></span>The three following chapters in the thesis brought forward the scientific dentations from Sibawayh's Kitab . These dentations verify the effects of context on Sibawayh's laying dwon the syntactical rules . So , the title of the second chapter was "the context's role in declensional guiding" . It contained the succeeding researches:<a href="#p7" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p8"></span>١) " context's importance in declensional guiding" . I indicated in this research that there are declensional structures do not be correct, it has not an entity, and we can not guide it declensionally but through context's evidence . I named that Sibawayh exploited the context in his declensional guiding . In this research, I stated that thecontext may be a reference to the pronoun in case of nonexistence of linguistic reference . I also cited that we will fail to take advantage of context, if we do not exploit it in our lingual analyzation .<a href="#p8" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p9"></span>٢) The second research in this chapter: "Enrichment of context for semantic , and declensional guiding . Deeply,I discussed in this chapter the role of context in enrichment of declensional guiding . I repoted here that the speaker's condition , his silence's potentialitydeclensional guiding , his will, and his psychological<a href="#p9" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
