In its obituary, the CMS suggested that since, "so long as there is a Christian Mission to Mohammedan countries, Pfander's works will endure," they should be translated "into English, as textbooks for Missionaries and Mission schools in all parts of Asia."]٣٤[<br><br>Appraisal<br>Pfander's approach perpetuated. The first English version of the Mizan appeared in ١٨٦٧; translations in other languages also continued to appear.

Tisdall largely continued Pfander's view, both of Islam as salvifically bankrupt and of Muhammad as morally culpable.

Others, including Imad-ud-Din and W. A. Rice, whose Crusaders of the Twentieth Century appeared in ١٩١٠, continued Pfander's approach, virtually without modification. William Muir, inspired by Pfander, surpassed him as a scholar but perpetuated his estimate of Islam. The fact, though, that Pfander's books remain in print today suggests that some Christians still value his approach. "We do not hesitate," says the preface to the ١٩٨٦ edition of the Mizan, "to print such a book of fundamental importance . . . Islam is still the same, and needs a definitive answer."<br><br>Pfander's approach modified. Bishop French acknowledged Pfander as his "Master in missions," as a "worthy successor of . . .

He thought that rational argument could never do justice to the mysterium that lies at the heart of Christian faith and aimed not so much to defeat Islam as to win Muslim hearts.]٣٥[Safdar Ali, in his Niaz nama (Friendly treatise), used "the persuasive tone born of love and a strong</p> </div>
