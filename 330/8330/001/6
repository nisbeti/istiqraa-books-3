The study also showed that the ordinary people of the book received their religion erroneously from their rabbis and monks, as well as they received Islam that led most of them to leave the spirit of belonging to any religion; they moved to atheism and secularism. Today, they need a pure Islamic approach to clarify for them the real Islam, expose to them the greatness of Islam, emphasize that Islam is eternal religion of God and religion of all messengers and prophets.<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
