<p><span class="anchor" id="p5"></span>The last tow points in the preface were about the texts which Sibawayh depended on: poetry; verses of the Holy Koran; Prophetic Traditions , and scientific rules which we must follow at the laying down the syntactical rules .<a href="#p5" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p6"></span>After the preface, I specified five chapters for the rest of the thesis . The first chapter is the relationship between Sibawayh and both of his method and context .<a href="#p6" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>

<p><span class="anchor" id="p8"></span>I. What were the circumstances which surrounded with Sibawayh at his the laying down the syntactical rules and his the declensional guiding?<a href="#p8" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p9"></span>II. Was he laying dwon his syntactical rules through the pronounced language or through written language?<a href="#p9" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p10"></span>III. Was he considering the effects of context' elements? or, Was he basically depending on the Regent's theory?<a href="#p10" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p11"></span>IV. What were the procedures which he had confidence in his laying down the syntactical rules .<a href="#p11" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p12"></span>Through these questions , the title of this chapter became "The Relationship Between Sibawayh And context And His Method In Al-Ktab" . This chapter embraced tow researches:<a href="#p12" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p13"></span>- The first is "Sibawayh and context" . It demonstrated that Sibawayh set up his laying down the syntactical rules and his declensional guiding through the pronounced language , and he did not avoid the contextual aspects of speaking . It also confirmed that he considered contextual components inlaying down the syntactical rules . I wrote dwon my notice that the conversationalist and addressee were the most<a href="#p13" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
