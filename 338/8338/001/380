<p><span class="anchor" id="p8"></span>While I was talking about context's term, I pointed to that old grammarians were using this term in their works , and they used it as an evidence in explanation of some syntactical issues .

<p><span class="anchor" id="p9"></span>Taking an interest of our previous scholars of context was also stated in this part .<a href="#p9" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>

<p><span class="anchor" id="p12"></span>The thesis' preface tackled the importance of context's consideration in the laying down the syntactical rules for language and the declensional guiding .<a href="#p12" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p13"></span>I made referece to that the nonattendance of context about the syntactical analyzation may lead to:<a href="#p13" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
