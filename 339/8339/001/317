For the possible reference to this tradition see Mishkat ul-Masabih, tr. by James Robson, Ashraf, Lahore,١٩٦٣, Book ١, ch. VI, p. ٤٩.<br>٢. It appears that Imad ud-Din is paraphrasing the above tradition. If the above reference (Note ١) to this tradition is correct, it is not really clear from this tradition that Muhammad forbade the reading of the other Holy Books, the existence and integrity of which find strong support in both the Qur'an and the Hadith. Elsewhere, according to the Mishkat ul-Masabih (Book XVI, ch, ١, p. ٧٥٨). Muhammad asks for information about a particular point in the Tawrat. Yet, unfortunately, it continues to be true that some Muslims revile other Muslims who read the Holy Bible.<br>٣. A. J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, Oxford University Press, London, ١٩٦٤.<br>٤. As far as I can determine, one kos is about two kilometres.<br>٥. The spelling of this name is not clear from the Urdu text.</p> </div>
