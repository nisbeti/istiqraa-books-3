<p><span class="anchor" id="p3"></span>In spite of all the different opinions in comparative religion science, I tried to benefit from the Western science and their opinions, as Sheikh RahmattAllah and his assistant Dr. Wazeer Khan did in the controversy. In this science after the analysis and induction and totally be scientific impartiality to clarify the argument and show the truth, though I think the refusal of comparative religion science based on the believing of comparing our religion with misrepresentative one. As this science discuss each person in terms of beliefs not others; thus it is considered the science in perspective of the "other" and not the "ego"<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p4"></span>I have tried in this research to clarify the characteristics and advantages of both Islam and Christians, in an analytical framework with comparison, not free from criticism for the most critical issues that is raised up between the two religions that discussed in the controversy. And most of these has been written about in Sheikh and pastor books. These issues has been taken for comparison and conclusion and propose suggestions<a href="#p4" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p5"></span>I have focused in this research on the five main issues between the sheikh and the pastor twisted, copying, triangulation, prophecy and Quran. In the triangulation, Phandar believes that the relationship between divinity and manhood is just a union not a blend relationship, and triangulation is wonder, understandable Secret, and must be believable. He has equated the divine of the attributes and the divine of Trinity. Sheikh RahmattAllah divided his in a more accurate and spoke about demolition of triangulation in several ways: mind and transport and Jesus Christ speech. He proved that if the true triangulation is found there must be real abundance. He mentioned that most of what Christians'belief in are statements from the Gospel of John Bible that is full of metaphor.<a href="#p5" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
