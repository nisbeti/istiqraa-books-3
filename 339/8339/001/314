<p class="hamesh">in the Lord. Through His grace I am experiencing spiritual progress. The Lord gives peace of heart.<br>All my friends, acquaintances, disciples, relatives and others have become enemies. At all times and in various ways everyone wants to afflict me, but knowing God's comfort, this does not bother me in the least. The more I suffer and am despised for the Lord, the greater the peace, the comfort and joy in my spirit. Of my relatives only my brothers, Malwawi Karim ud-din and Munshi Khayr ud-Din, as well as Muhammad Husayn of Kirana and my father, continue to love me and write me. Apart from them, all my relatives and friends have turned away. I pray that God would have mercy on all of them and open their eyes so that they too may enter into the eternal salvation of our God, through the grace of our Lord Jesus. Amen.<br><br>APPENDIX<br>In ١٨٦٦ I wrote my life story and am now adding this Appendix in ١٨٧٣. I am extremely grateful to God for the events in my life which have taken place during this seven year period after my conversion to Christianity.<br>When I was baptized, my wife was very displeased with me. In my pride I was content to be compelled to leave her alone with the children for the sake of Christ. By God's grace she also acquired some knowledge about Christ and became a Christian. All my five sons and four daughters were baptized, but one son, Hamid ud-Din, went to be with God. The rest are with me in this world as servants of the Messiah.<br>While in an unconscious state my respected father received baptism, along with the children. However, at the time of his death Muslim relatives claimed him as a Muslim. At that time, he had lost all consciousness and old age had deprived him of his season. But it is my hope that the Most High God, who is gracious and who allowed him to live to hear the Good News, will also save his soul. What of it that Muslims buried him according to their own rites. My brother Mawlawi Karim ud-Din continues as before. He has still not come to the Messiah. Other relatives have died. Indeed, some other friends also have heeded God's Word and a few have become Christians.<br>God has granted me a second blessing by relieving me from worldly activity to be a servant of His Word. Though I am unworthy and unable to fulfill what He requires of me, He has blessed me and will care for me until the end.<br>Thus, to detail this matter briefly, after I became a Christian, I was equally as saddened and even ashamed that I had spent so great a part of my life as a Muslim and had wasted my time apart from God as I was happy in finding the Messiah. Though I have found much comfort in the Parable of the Labourers (Injil, Matthew ٢٠: ١ - ١٦), I was particularly concerned to spend the rest of my life in the service of Him whom I found, in whom my heart delighted and who captivated my being.
